**What to do if I wannna receive DM/Messages from specific members?(When I had disallowed to receive direct messages from the server members)**

If you want to have specific members to send you messages you can add them as friend and then they will be able to send you DM/Messages anytime. And if then you don't want them to send you DM/Messages you can unfriend him/her.

**You can change your status**
